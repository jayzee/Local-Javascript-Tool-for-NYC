The code is built using jquery and MomentJS(moment.js). Moment is used to properly format the time and dates.

The tool shows 10 results of Meetups happening with the word javascript in their description. Users can select favorite events by clicking the 'favorite' button.

Users can update the pages results by inputting a new zip code or adding a search term in the forms at the top of the page.
